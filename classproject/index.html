				<h2>How to study web development?</h2>
				<p>How to learn web development for beginners? Here I write down some of my suggestions for reference only. </p>
				<p>Step 1: learning HTML and CSS HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the core of a web page, and learning HTML well is the basic condition for web developers. Html is easy to learn, but it is also easy to misuse. It takes a lot of effort to learn it well. With the development and popularization of HTML5, understanding HTML5 will become a required course for web developers. When it comes to the appearance of a web page, you need to learn CSS. It can help you make your web page more beautiful. Use HTML and CSS to simulate the layout and layout (colors, images, text styles, etc.) of some websites you've seen.</p>
				<p>Step 2: Learn JavaScript, understand DOM JavaScript is a program language that can make your web page more lively. Learn the basic syntax of JavaScript, learn to use JavaScript to operate DOM elements in web pages. Then learn to use some JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery, which most web developers like to use. JQuery can effectively improve the development efficiency of JavaScript.</p>
				<p>Step 3: you don't have to spend too much effort on understanding the web server, but it's relatively easy to learn the basic configuration of IIS and Apache, and it won't take long. Learn a little bit about UNIX and Linux, because most web servers run on UNIX and Linux platforms.</p>
				<p>Step 4: Learn a server-side scripting language Server-side scripting (background development) is also one of the basic skills of a Web developer. You just pick a server-side scripting language and learn it.At present, the popular server scripting languages are: PHP, asp.net, JSP, ruby, python, etc.</p>
				<p>Step 5: Learn the database and SQL syntax To build dynamic pages usually use the database, commonly used databases such as SQLServer, Oracle, MySQL, etc., they will follow the standard SQL principles.Generally, asp.net programs use SqlServer database, PHP, Java use Oracle, MySQL database.</p>
				<p>Step 6: comprehensive practical choose a background you like programming language, combined with prior to learn HTML, CSS, javascript, front technology, the implementation of a simple guestbook, BBS program, thus to realize a simple CMS (content management system) </p>
				<p>There's still a lot of content, from the simplest HTML to Web frameworks, and mastering each of these technologies is a lot of work.Half a year is enough time for you to have an effective understanding of Web development. Then, think about your direction for further study.</p>
